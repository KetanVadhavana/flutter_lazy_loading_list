# Lazy loading / infinite list with Progress Indicator in footer

This flutter demo app shows how to create a lazy loading GridView with progress indicator in the footer. In this example I am using <code>SliverGrid</code> for GridView. Use <code>SliverList</code> for a ListView.

Please note this is just a demo app to show the use of <code>CustomScrollView</code> to add footer in your list and <code>ScrollController</code> to make next page requests. Along with it, this demo also show the use of <code>Ink</code>, <code>InkWell</code>, <code>SizedBox</code> and <code>Theme</code> widgets.
